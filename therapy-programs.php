						<h1>Therapy Programs</h1>
						
						<p>
						Therapion's online therapy programs consist of a 4-session package with your personal counselor, psychologist or psychotherapist. It may also include some homework, and it can be combined with a self-help program based on Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) if desired.
						</p>
						
						
						<p>
						Our programs are active, structured therapy programs that can be applied to most psychological problems such as stress, anxiety, depression, low self-esteem, loneliness, social fears, relationship problems, etc. These programs are not suitable for emergency situations. 
						</p>
						
						
						<p>
						There are three different programs to choose from. Each program lasts four sessions, and it is possible to combine them for a longer duration of therapy if needed.

						<h4>Program One</h4>
						<p>
						<em>
						2 x email + 2 x video conference, 4 sessions 	
                                                <br />
                                                Cost: 170 USD - 10% discount, final price: 153 USD 
						</em>
						</p>
						
						<p>
						Email is best for those who have limited time, are available at non-traditional times or for those who want time to consider their response. The live video sessions are quite similar to a face-to-face session, however you can have this session from anywhere in the world, at a time that works best in your schedule.

						<h4>Program Two</h4>
						<p>
						<em>
                                                2 x chat + 2 x video conference, 4 sessions
                                                <br />
						Cost: 200 USD - 10% discount, final price: 180 USD
						</em>
						</p>
					
						<p>
						This program is ideal for those who value more instant feedback. Chatting enables you to process your concerns in writing without having to wait for a response as you would with email. Video sessions closely simulate the fullness of interaction provided by traditional counseling. 
						</p>
						
						
						<h4>Program Three</h4>
						<p>
						<em>
						4 x video conference, 4 sessions
						<br />
						Cost: 240 USD - 10% discount, final price: 216 USD
						</em>
						</p>
						
						<p>
						This program is ideal for those who prefer to talk instead of writing. You get instant feedback and can discuss your situation either with audio only, or with a webcam and audio. This is an interactive and guided journey to a new way of understanding and living your life.
