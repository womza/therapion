						Confidential Online Counseling 
						</h2>
						
<p>
All our counselors, psychologists, and therapists are fully licensed and registered. Your confidentiality and privacy is guaranteed. Our site is safe, reliable, and easy to use.
</p>

<p> 
The benefits of online therapy are supported by scientific evidence. It works in the same way as traditional face-to-face therapy. We provide online therapy by qualified professionals (counselors, psychologists and therapists) to address a variety of individual, family, and social issues.
</p>

<p>
Our online therapy and online counseling specialties include, but are not limited to: stress, depression, anxiety, loneliness, self-esteem, social anxiety, eating disorders and obesity, shyness, guilt, anger, relationship advice, marriage and couples counseling, life transition counseling, and expat coaching.
</p>

<p>
Our work is based on the premise that addressing the underlying causes of a problem is ultimately more effective than just addressing its symptoms. We promote positive change in individuals, families, and communities.
</p>

<h3>						
Is Online Therapy Effective?
</h3>

<p>
Recent research has shown that online therapy using live chat is as effective as traditional face-to-face sessions. 
At Therapion we believe that the effectiveness of online therapy is further enhanced by also offering e-mail and video conferencing as an option to our clients. 
Research also indicates that many people feel less inhibited when using online services. 
This is particularly useful when high levels of shame or embarrassment make it hard for clients to discuss these concerns face-to-face.

						<h3>Benefits of Online Therapy</h3> 
                               						                                               
						
					                                         	<p>
                                                E-therapy is available at any time, any day of the week, is more affordable than traditional face-to-face therapy, and you can pay online. It makes counseling accessible to people living in remote areas. 
                                                It also provides a more confidential service for those living in small communities.  
                                                For busy people, online therapy enables you to access a service at a time that is convenient to you. It is useful for those with childcare commitments, and can be very helpful for anyone that has difficulty travelling to an appointment. Younger clients often prefer online therapy, because they are more engaged with new technology.
                                                In short, online therapy is flexible, easily accessible and cost-effective.
